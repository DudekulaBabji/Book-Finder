##  How It Works

When a user enters a book title and submits the form, the app sends a request to the [Open Library Search API](https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title=) and displays the results in a list format.

1)The user enters a book title into the search bar.

2)When the search button is clicked, the app makes a fetch request to the Open Library Search API.

3)The API returns a JSON response containing a list of books related to the search query.

4)The app extracts important details such as:

    Book Title

    Author Name(s)

    First Publish Year

5)The results are displayed dynamically on the screen in a clean list format.

6)If no books are found, the app shows a message to let the user know.

7)Since the app uses React, every time a new search is made, the state updates automatically and re-renders the results without refreshing the page.
